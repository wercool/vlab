History and Theory:
The characteristic example of motion of body with variable mass is motion of jet-projectile (rockets) under the action of outflowing gases from an engine. Interest to such kind devices rose in the last century in connection with possibility of these devices to achieve space speeds up to 10 km/s.

Jet propulsion is based on a law of saving of impulse and the theory of motion of body with variable mass.

Principle of rocket acceleration is simple. Gases, outflowing from an engine, take away some impulse.The rocket with rest of fuel gets the same impulse, being together with gases the closed system. It is assumed that external forces are not present.
